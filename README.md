3. The whole page has been broken down in chapters with the time it should take to cover, where you can read about the theory and practical exercises.

## Module 0.1 - Introduction
1. There is no shortcut to understanding and learning the foundational concept of anything.
2. Read the modules step by step at your own pace. Keep on coming back if you don't understand anything, or do ChatGPT if you are not able to understand it. Like "dumb it down for me".
3. Audience: Anyone who wants to start from the basics.

## Module 0.2 - Building the basic understanding
Go to this website and read all the chapters
1. Book here: [Nueral Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html). Skip the warning
Now, you are ready to start in the field of Healthcare imaging. Let's start with the understanding of the basic principles of pictures in radiology

## Module 0.3 - Building the foundation of mathematics
If you really want to deep dive into the theoretical part of machine learning and AI, then you need to be good at maths. Otherwise you can skip the mathematics.
### Mathematics concepts
1. Linear algebra - refer to 3Blue1Brown lecture series - [Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)

### Advanced users
If you don't have Linear algebra or a college-level understanding of mathematics, refer to this book. You need to be patient while following the book [Click](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)

## Module 1 - The Evolution of the "AI Doctor" (1970s - 2025)
Notebook: [01_history_of_medical_ai.ipynb](chapters/01_history_of_medical_ai.ipynb)
### Why this module?
This chapter de-mystifies AI by showing how medical problems shaped each era of AI, and why the methods evolved over time.
### Learning objectives
1. Distinguish between rule-based AI and modern machine learning.
2. Understand the "AI Winter" in medicine and why early promises failed.
3. Identify the clinical bottlenecks that led to deep learning and generative AI.
4. Evaluate the trade-off between explainability (rules) and performance (neural nets).
### What you'll do
1. Explore a timeline from MYCIN to LLMs.
2. Build a tiny expert system and fix a rule.
3. Adjust a risk model weight and see how predictions change.
4. See why pixels need deep learning and why LLMs can help with notes.
